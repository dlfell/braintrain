FIRST CALL FOR THE FOURTH LEARNING AND PLASTICITY MEETING, Äkäslompolo, Finland, April 8-11, 2018 


A cross-disciplinary meeting that connects psychological and neuroscience research on the mechanisms of learning and brain plasticity
The special theme of the LaP 2018 meeting is ageing but submissions reflecting the whole spectrum of learning and plasticity research are encouraged.


The LaP 2018 keynote speaker is Professor Kirk Erickson (Brain Aging & Cognitive Health Lab, University of Pittsburgh, USA)
Informal atmosphere and small size (maximum 100 participants) helps to connect participants and promotes discussion
Excellent possibilities for winter sports and other outdoors activities
Despite of its location way above the Polar Circle, the congress site is easy to reach by flight or by train
